## Description

This project is an abstract portrait of myself where the eye was meant to be the main focus. The work is interactive, using mouseX and mouseY to move two rectangles. At first one rectangle held my eye, but while experimenting I created a circular pattern that replaced it. The eye then reappeared at the bottom of the canvas, which changed the balance of the piece.
This project was more experimental and outside of my comfort zone. I had never made this type of circular pattern before, so I was learning as I coded. Because of that the portrait turned out differently than I first imagined, but I decided to keep it that way since it reflects the process of trying something new.
The project uses variables, mouse interactivity, and abstract shapes
