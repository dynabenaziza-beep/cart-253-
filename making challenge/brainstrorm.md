#  1: There could be a time limit of 1 minute max where the player catch the most flies( is 1 mins too much , how should the timer look like , should it be simple or part of the aesthetic of the ga,e ) 

#  2: the  frog can moove around the entire square , and the player can moove it up and down with the keyboard ( will it be too hard to code ) 

#  3: could change the algorithm of the flies, istead of just fleeing in one direction they could go fast or slow , or even come from different directions ( it need to be a fixed algorithm , will the player notice the pattern and guess when the next flie will come , how do i make it hard to gues ?) 

#   4:  There could be a night mode where the game turn dark and the flies become invisible ( how will the player   know that they killed a flies, maybe with a sound effect ?) 

#   5: replace the flies with other objects, so it’s harder for the frog to catch things (for example, if there’s a cup or another random object, the frog can’t eat it and dies, so the player has to be careful to eat only the real flies).


#  6:  could add levels, where the player has to survive for a certain time (like 1 minute) and try to reach the maximum level.

#  7: could add red flies that are not eatable (if the frog eats them, it dies. Maybe to make it fair, the player could have 3 hearts, and if they eat a red fly three times, the game is over)

#  8: In terms of visuals, I’d add a background inspired by the swamp in the Shrek movie (maybe add un marais , or a river )

#  9:  I could put a fly at the top of the screen, and the only way to reach it is to make the frog jump. The frog would jump up and then go back to its original position ( will this work)

#  10: I could make small and big flies, where some are easier and some are harder to catch. Maybe the frog has to bite the big fly twice to eat it completely.

# 11:could add sound effects ( a  really soft  sound when the frog catches a fly, and a loud sound when it catches something that isn’t a fly)


#  12: instead of just making the flies invisible at night, i could make invisible flies that appear only for a second before disappearing again, so the player has to be more focused and attentive to catch them in time. 


#  13: make the frong tired if it move too much ( the frog goes slower and slower or just not able to jump high ) 

#  14:  make the backgound change depending on the time ( if i put a timer, i can make the timer the hour of the day , for example if it is 30 seconds into the game it is 12pm and if it is  45 seconds , it become night ) 

# 15: if i take idea 14 , i call the game " a day in the life of a frog " ( making a sort of context for the game , where would i put the tittle , on top of the screen ? ) 

#  16: for the visual could add a sun at the top left of the screen and make it slowly dissapear depending on the timer 

#  17:  make a special potion to be able to pause the day ( could slie one or two magic potion to be able to stop time for the frog to eat the most flies , how would the potion look ? , how much time should it be ?) 

#  18: make the flies more realistic by adding small gray wings and giving their body a more detailed shape ( how will the body look ? should i stay the same size or make it a litle bit bigger 

#  19 : make the canvas size a bit smaller to add more susppense , so when the fly appears the player doesnt have much time to react and catch it ( cut on the widht or the lenght , will it affect the movement of the frog ? ) 

#   20 : when the timer is over the background could slowly turn red or darker ( should it be imidiately black at the end of the timer or should it start slowly 5 seconds before the timer end )
