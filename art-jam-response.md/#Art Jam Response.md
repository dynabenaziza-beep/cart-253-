#Art Jam Response

Daniel’s project stood out because of how well made it was. The mouse movement is smooth and the interaction feels natural. The eye following the mouse is the best part. It’s simple but adds emotion, like the face is aware of the viewer. The soft background colors help keep the focus on the face and make the movement feel alive.
The code is very detailed with 1,014 lines. It shows a lot of work and structure. The functions hud() and handleHud() connect different parts of the program clearly. The use of data and container functions instead of simple variables like
let x = 0;
let y = 0;

shows a good understanding of how to make the code reusable. This means the same parts can be used again instead of writing new ones every time. It also makes it easier to fix or add things later because everything in the program works together smoothly.
The commit messages are short but clear, showing an organized way of working. It made me see how small updates can really help when building big projects. One improvement could be adding a restart button so the player doesn’t need to refresh the page each time.

#Emmett’s Project

This project is a creative self-portrait where each eye reacts separately to the mouse. It makes the piece fun to interact with. The use of the MP3 library for sound adds another layer to the experience. The sound reacts to the mouse movement, which connects what is seen and what is heard.
The program uses if-statements to link the mouse position with the eye reaction, making the movement smooth and controlled. The only thing to change could be the eye shape. Replacing the arc with an ellipse would make the eyes look more realistic and allow the pupil to move more freely.
ellipse(210, 240, 40, 40);

#Ray’s Project

The most interesting part of this project is how the viewer can grab and drag the cookie or the spider anywhere on the screen. This adds a real sense of interaction that makes the piece feel alive. The code uses the mouseDragged() function with constrain() to keep the objects inside the canvas, keeping everything stable.
The grab offset lets the viewer pick up the object from any point, not just the center. This is really smart because it makes the movement smoother and more natural. Many projects forget to add this, but it makes a big difference. It shows a good understanding of how to connect the viewer’s actions to what happens on screen.
The project has a clear Halloween theme, and the interaction fits well with it.

#Overall Reflection

All three projects have clear and well-structured code. Each one uses functions to control how things move and react. The use of variables and conditions shows a good understanding of how to make the code respond to the viewer.
Functions like mouseDragged() and constrain() are used in smart ways to keep movements smooth and inside the canvas. The commit messages are short but easy to understand, showing a clear and organized process.
The code in all three projects is well planned and makes everything work together nicely. It showed me how important good structure and organization are when building interactive work.
