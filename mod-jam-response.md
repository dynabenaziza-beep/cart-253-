Mod Jam Response
During Mod Jam, I reviewed three different projects made by my classmates: Daniel Michurov, Emmett Walthers, and Ray Hernaez. Even though all three followed the same base frog game, the final results were completely different. What I found most surprising was how much personality and creativity each person added to their version. It made me realize how much freedom there actually is inside a simple structure, and how small decisions in code or design can totally change the feeling of a game.


1. Daniel Michurov’s Project

Daniel Michurov’s game had the strongest atmosphere out of the three. The color palette — soft blues mixed with a warm yellow gradient — didn’t just look nice, it created a mood. The background even looked like stained-glass windows, which gave the game a kind of sacred or symbolic feeling. This was something I didn’t expect to see in a frog game, so it surprised me in a good way.
The most memorable feature was the huge eye following the flies. That detail made me feel watched while playing, which added tension and made the experience feel more alive. The flies also had different movement patterns, which kept the gameplay interesting and unpredictable.
The only thing I struggled with was the frog movement. Sometimes it stretched or lagged a bit, which made it harder to control, but it didn’t ruin the experience.
What impressed me the most was the amount of code — around 955 lines. Seeing that much work made me realize how much effort went into small details. It felt more like an art project than just a game mod.


2. Emmett Walthers’ Project

Emmett Walthers’ game had a totally different tone. It was fun, playful, and very polished. The home page immediately caught my eye because of the cute frog design that reminded me of old-school googly-eye toys. What surprised me the most was the moving title. This small animation made it feel like a real game you would download . It gave the game a strong identity.
The flies coming from the top instead of the sides was a smart twist. It changed the rhythm of the game and made it feel more vertical, which I thought was refreshing. The code was simple, but the visuals were clean and showed real effort — especially the circles drawn repeatedly to build shapes. Everything felt handcrafted, which added charm.
Overall, Emmett’s project surprised me with how polished and confident it felt, even with simple code.


3. Ray Hernaez’s Project

Ray Hernaez’s game stood out the most for usability. The instructions explaining which keys to use were super helpful, and honestly, I wish every game had that. It made the experience feel smoother and more welcoming.
I also liked that the frog didn’t use a normal tongue but threw something instead — that gave the game originality. Ray added several types of insects, and each one had its own movement style: buzzing in one spot, moving up and down, or having different speeds. This made the game more fun because I started to learn the patterns and adjust how I played.
The cartoonish style of the title and win/fail messages matched the vibe of the game and made everything feel complete and intentional.
