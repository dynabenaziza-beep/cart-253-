## Description

This project is a small collection of three different frog games.
The idea was to take the same character (a frog) and try making different versions of it with new mechanics each time.
Each variation plays differently and has its own little style.
There is no sound in the project.

Variation 1: Detective Frog
In this version, the frog is a detective. You move the frog with the mouse and click to shoot the tongue upward.
The goal is to hit the three good trashcans and avoid the dangerous one that rotates.
New thing added here: the rotating trashcan that moves in a circle and instantly ends the game if touched.
This wasn’t in the original frog.


Variation 2: Spider Frog
This version is more about movement. You control the frog with the arrow keys or WASD.
There are stones you can collect and insects flying around.
New thing added here: the collectible stones and the moving insects that follow different movement patterns.
This mechanic wasn’t in the original frog either.


Variation 3: Garfield Frog
This version is based on a timer. You move the frog with the arrow keys and try to eat as many flies as possible.
Different flies affect the timer in different ways. There is also a start screen, instructions, a win screen, and a game over screen.
New thing added here: the timer system and fly types with different effects, plus the full opening and ending screens.
